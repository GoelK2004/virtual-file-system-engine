# Virtual File System (VFS)

A high-performance, modular, and feature-rich **Virtual File System** built from scratch in **C++**, designed to emulate real-world file systems like ext4 or NTFS. This system includes advanced components such as journaling, permission management, metadata caching, and multi-filesystem mounting, making it a complete simulation of how modern file systems work.

---

## Features

### Core File System
- Disk-based file system built using a raw `myDisk.img` file
- Custom block size support for flexibility
- File and directory creation with user-defined sizes

### Metadata Management
- `FileEntry` system supporting:
  - File name, size, extents
  - Timestamps (created, modified, accessed)
  - Permissions (owner, group, others)
  - Attributes (hidden, read-only, system, archive)
- Centralized metadata table with B+ Tree indexing for fast access

### Efficient File Allocation
- **Bitmap + Extents** used for block allocation
- Reduced fragmentation and fast read/write performance

### Journaling System
- Write-Ahead Logging for crash recovery
- Journaling of create, delete, write, rename, and permission change operations
- Recovery on boot using uncommitted journal entries

### User and Permission Management
- User/group management (`userAdd`, `login`, `chown`, `chmod`, `chgrp`)
- `whoami` command to show current session
- Secure password handling
- UID/GID mapping and enforcement of file access rights

### Metadata Caching
- In-memory caching for Superblock, Bitmap, and Metadata
- Reduced disk I/O on frequent access

### Fault Tolerance & Rollback
- Journaling recovery
- Safe rollback of metadata and data block allocations during crashes

### Directory Management
- Nested directory support
- `cd`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, and `tree` navigation
- Path resolution and absolute/relative path support

### Mounting System
- Mount and unmount multiple file systems at different virtual mount paths
- Independent management of mounted disks
- CLI supports switching between mounted filesystems
